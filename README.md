<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
In the hope of getting to know more about Mars and the possibility of life on its surface, a huge number of exploratory missions to different regions of the planet need to be conducted. Imagine (at some future time) that we have several rovers of different types and capabilities on the surface of Mars ready to carry out missions to its different regions. There is also a hypothetical base station that acts as the central point from which the different rovers begin their exploratory missions and to which they return after mission completion. The base station basically assigns missions to the different rovers.
Using the programming skills and our knowledge of the different data structures, we are going to develop a program that simulates the mission assignment process and calculates some related statistics in order to help improve the overall process.
